# Data Analysis Project Template

## Description
This repository is a template designed to provide a standard structure for a data analysis project. It includes essential files, directories, and configurations to get your project started quickly.

## Folder Structure
```bash
data-analysis-template/
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── data/                 # Raw and processed data for the project
│   ├── raw/              # Folder for raw data files
│   └── processed/        # Folder for cleaned and processed data
├── notebooks/            # Jupyter notebooks for analysis and exploration
│   └── analysis.ipynb    # Example Jupyter notebook for analysis
├── src/                  # Scripts for data processing and analysis
│   ├── data_preprocessing.py  # Example script for data cleaning and preprocessing
│   └── analysis.py       # Example script for data analysis
├── tests/                # Unit tests for the project
│   └── test_processing.py    # Example unit test for data processing functions
├── requirements.txt      # List of project dependencies (Python)
├── .gitignore            # Git ignore file to exclude unnecessary files
└── LICENSE               # Project license (e.g., MIT License)
```
## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to your project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd data-analysis-template
   ```

3. **Install project dependencies (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start working on your analysis!** You can begin by exploring the `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and modify the scripts in the `src/` folder for data processing.

## Folder Breakdown

- **`data/`**: This folder holds both raw and processed data. Raw data should be kept in `raw/`, while cleaned data goes into `processed/`.
  
- **`notebooks/`**: Store your Jupyter notebooks here. These notebooks are ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and model experimentation.
  
- **`src/`**: Contains your Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and any other custom functions. In my project structures, it usually comes at a second step after the initial data exploration in a notebook.
  
- **`tests/`**: Unit tests for your scripts, especially for functions used in advanced data processing. This ensures the correctness of your data pipelines and analysis logic.

## Usage

- **Data Processing**: Add your data processing logic in the `src/data_preprocessing.py` file. This script should clean, transform, and organize the data to be used in analysis or modeling.
  
- **Analysis**: The `src/analysis.py` script can be used to carry out your main analysis, including any statistical methods, visualizations, or model development.
  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use the `notebooks/` folder for interactive work, such as initial exploration the dataset, to try different approaches, and visualizing the data.

## Running Tests

To run tests, you can use a testing framework like `pytest`. Here’s a simple example:

```bash
pytest tests/
```
Make sure your functions, especially in `data_preprocessing.py` and `analysis.py`, are thoroughly tested.

### Key Features:

- **Ready for Data Analysis**: The template is structured for any data analysis project, from raw data to analysis results.
- **Modular Structure**: You can cleanly separate data, scripts, notebooks, and tests, making your project easy to scale and maintain.
- **Testing Included**: Example unit tests for data processing are included to help ensure the reliability of your code.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use the `notebooks/` folder for interactive data exploration, visualization, and experimentation.

### Next Steps:

- After duplicating this repo, update the `README.md` to describe your specific analysis project.
- Add any required dependencies to `requirements.txt`.
- Begin developing your project within the `src/` and `notebooks/` directories.
