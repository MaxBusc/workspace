# FACILITACCT - Climate Change Adaptation Dashboard

**FACILITACCT** is a project aimed at helping local communities track and adapt to climate change. As a volunteer, I am working alongside a squad of 4 data analysts/engineers using the KANBAN methodology to provide agricultural key data to local communities. This data will support their efforts to monitor and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to aggregate and analyze agricultural data, helping local communities understand the impact of climate change on agriculture and supporting their adaptation efforts.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (for data processing)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **SQL** (for data queries and aggregation)

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of various datasets to understand patterns and trends in agricultural data.
- **Data Aggregation**: Combining and summarizing datasets to provide key insights.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing the aggregated data to uncover relationships and impacts related to climate change and agriculture.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facilitacct.git
